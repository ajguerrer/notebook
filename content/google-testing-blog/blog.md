- Test binary size and RAM have strong correlations on whether a test is flaky. This includes the

## Productivity

- Releasing often give teams an incentive to automate testing and reduce coupling with the rest of

## Code Health

- When a team provides [fakes](../tott/#know-your-test-doubles) and writes tests for them, they 
  become clients of their own software. Experiencing the perspective of the client gives the team an 
  incentive to make their API easier to use. -
